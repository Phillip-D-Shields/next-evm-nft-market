# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

fire up a blockchain instance for dev 
```yarn hardhat node```

deploy the contracts onto the blockchain instance
```yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost```

fire up the dApp ui for dev
```yarn dev```
